When data size increaes the F1 score of DT and SVM slightly increaes, but larger improvment for LR. When compare the F1 scores in test with in train, DT has the smallest variance, it means Decision Tree does better in generalizaion, SVM and LR both have relative large variance and show similar performance. As for the training time, SVM and DT are close when the data size is 100, and traning time of SVM increases fast as the data size increases, meanwihle for DT the training time even slightly decreses. The same thing happend on prediction time for SVM and DT. For LR, its training time is much higher than DT and SVM when the data size is 100, and slightly increases as the data size grows, when data size is 300, its traning time is similar with SVM's. \n",

    "**Answer: **Decision Tree is model that seperates data by asking a seris of questions. To generate a Decision tree, first i would pick a feature and seperate the data into two groups, then i pick another feature to do the same thing for those two groups of data i just splited, finally at end point the data is pure. Once you have this model, you can classify the new data by asking the same questions and follow the path to the endpoint. This method is just like people deciding whether to go for a movies by asking questions like: who is the director, what's the type of the movies and how's the ticket price, etc. It is important to pick the right features to do the best seperations. By 'best', i mean the feature should be able to seperate the data to get the most information. For exmaple, if a person doesn't care about who's the director of the movie, then who's director is not a good question to ask. Because you don't get any information by doing that. But the person choose to go for a movie if the movie is action, and choose not go if it's not action, then if it's action movie is a good feature to pick, you don't even bother to look at other features. In this situation, by asking this question you gain the most information. That's how to pick features when seperating the data in Decision Tree."

The training score slightly decresed and the testing score slightly increased after tuning. So i would say the model has better generalization ability after tuning."
